1. Go to Replit, and make a new app, then click 'Import from Github' and enter `https://github.com/huggywuggybest03/replit-miner`
2. After it has succeeded, go to install.sh and change the wallet to your wallet, which is the -u section.
3. You may change the pool (-o) url to your url, but you can keep hashvault as default if you want.
4. You can change the -t section to the amount of CPU's to use. Default is 1 for free apps.
5. Run the index.js and it will automaticially give permissions and run.
6. Done! Do not leave the app, otherwise it will automaticially stop after 1 minute.

(Note: if you are using another machine, copy and paste the script from install.sh, make sure wget is installed with `apt update && apt install wget`
